/**
 * Drift Sync Check — the deterministic REPLACEMENT for the 916-line LLM
 * anti-cheat predicate (`drift-success-predicate.ts`, spec §3/§6).
 *
 * `drift-sync.ts` (C2) never freewrites a fix — it only ever performs one of
 * two deterministic, data-only edits: (a) append one comment-marked family
 * literal to a `model-registry.ts` set (a recorded deprecation, or a
 * human-approved new family), or (b) drop a needs-human dedup note file
 * under `drift-proposals/`. Because the SYNC path can no longer produce an
 * arbitrary diff, verifying it is "real" no longer needs adversarial-intent
 * modeling or TS-diff parsing (the predicate's whole reason for being 916
 * lines) — it only needs three trivial, mechanical assertions:
 *
 *   1. CHANGED-FILE ALLOWLIST — every file the sync touched is either the
 *      model-registry DATA file or a `drift-proposals/` note file. Anything
 *      else (detector source, predicate, test harness, *.drift.ts, schema,
 *      sdk-shapes, CI workflow, ...) fails closed.
 *   2. CHECKSUM-PIN RE-ASSERT — P0's `logic-pin.test.ts` must still be green
 *      after the sync. Being on the allowlist above does NOT exempt
 *      `model-registry.ts` from this: a sync that mutated a frozen surface
 *      inside that file (familySet, NON_MODEL_TOKENS, PREVIEW_FAMILY, ...)
 *      is caught here even though the file itself was "allowed" to change.
 *   3. CLEAN RE-COLLECT — a fresh drift-report-collector run reports zero
 *      residual critical diffs, so a sync that claims to resolve drift but
 *      didn't is never waved through.
 *
 * No LLM, no model call, no heuristic scoring — every one of the three gates
 * above is a plain data check. A sync that fails any of them is NOT resolved
 * and no PR opens (mirrors the predicate's fail-closed contract, spec §3).
 *
 * WHAT GATE-3 IS AND IS NOT (run 31465219443, 2026-08-11). The re-collect runs
 * in the same workspace as the fix, so it can FILTER a cheat but cannot PROVE
 * correctness — that has always been its contract. What it also cannot do is
 * answer a question about an edit it has no surface for: two consecutive runs of
 * the identical changeset `74f6efa43753f7d0` (two gemini deprecations) got
 * `gate-failed` and then `ok-applied`, because gate-3's input is a fresh LIVE
 * observation of EVERY drift surface aimock has, and nothing about that is a
 * function of the changeset. So gate-3 now:
 *
 *   * is SKIPPED, with the reason recorded in the verdict, when the caller knows
 *     a re-collect cannot observe this run's edit (`skipRecollect`);
 *   * REFUSES on a positive critical finding and NAMES the diffs, so the next
 *     refusal is triageable from the log instead of being a bare count;
 *   * stops claiming "clean re-collect" for a zero it cannot believe — a
 *     quarantined or AG-UI-skipped report is reported as UNCONFIRMED, carried by
 *     gates 1 and 2 (see `reportTrustNote`).
 *
 * C5 only ADDS this script + its test. Wiring it into `fix-drift.yml` in place
 * of the "Assert drift truly resolved" step, and deleting
 * `drift-success-predicate.ts`, is C3's job.
