/**
 * Assertions on the "Verify pinned npm release is published" step of
 * .github/workflows/publish-release.yml.
 *
 * That step is the gate that stops aimock-pytest shipping a pin to an npm
 * version that was never published. It used to ask npm exactly once, so it
 * raced the registry: on the v1.41.0 release (run 34546620094) the publish job
 * landed 1.41.0 at 00:30:31 and this step asked for it at 00:30:49 — 18
 * seconds later — and npm answered E404. The version existed. Re-running the
 * job unchanged passed, publishing nothing.
 *
 * These guards EXECUTE the step's own `run:` body under bash against a stub
 * `npm`, because the only claim worth pinning is behavioural. The important
 * half is NOT that a propagating publish now survives — it is the negative
 * controls: a retry loop that swallowed a genuinely-missing version would be a
 * strictly worse bug than the race it fixed.
