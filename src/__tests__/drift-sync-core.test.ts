/**
 * C2: deterministic drift-sync CORE — the DATA-only, ZERO-LLM replacement for
 * the freewriter's DECISION role on the model-churn (add/deprecate) leg.
 *
 * Exercises `runDriftSyncCore` and its building blocks (the mirrored
 * classification predicates, the AST-located mechanical registry edits, and
 * the needs-human dedup note-file mechanism) purely over injected deps — no
 * real fs/git/network I/O, so every scenario below is deterministic and fast.
 *
 * RED (observed before this module existed): `scripts/drift-sync.ts` exported
 * only the C1 git/branch/commit/PR plumbing (todayStamp, exec, getChangedFiles,
 * buildPrBody, gatedCommitFiles, ...) — none of `runDriftSyncCore`,
 * `detectDeprecatedFamiliesForSync`, `addFamilyLiteralInSource`, etc. existed,
 * so a live churn scenario (a new classified model, or a retired family) had NO
 * mechanical sync path at all: the only remediation route was the LLM
 * freewriter. Verbatim capture of that RED state (this test file against the
 * pre-C2 module) is in the slot's final report.
