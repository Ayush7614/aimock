/**
 * Single source of truth for drift *surfaces*.
 *
 * A "surface" is one provider-endpoint shape that emits an `API DRIFT
 * DETECTED:` block (e.g. Cohere /v2/chat, Bedrock Invoke, OpenAI Images). Each
 * surface is identified by a stable machine slug (e.g. `"cohere-chat"`) that the
 * emitter declares via `formatDriftReport(context, diffs, surface)` and the
 * drift-report collector resolves back to the source file(s) that must be fixed.
 *
 * WHY a registry (not title-substring matching): the collector historically
 * keyed a drift block by `text.includes(<PROVIDER_MAP key>)` against ~9
 * hardcoded provider names. ~15 additional surfaces emit valid, fully-parseable
 * drift blocks whose PROSE titles are not keys, so they resolved to `null` →
 * quarantine (exit 5) → the auto-fix workflow (which gates on exit 2) never ran
 * for them. A slug-keyed registry shared by BOTH the emitter (schema.ts) and the
 * collector makes adding a surface a single edit that both consumers see, and
 * lets an unkeyed-but-emitting surface fail LOUDLY instead of silently
 * quarantining.
 *
 * This module is imported by:
 *   - `schema.ts` — validates a passed `surface` slug at emit time.
 *   - `scripts/drift-report-collector.ts` — resolves a slug to a source file.
 *   - `scripts/drift-report-collector.ts` legacy fallback — matches a no-marker
 *     block against the `provider` labels below (back-compat).
 */

/**
 * How a surface slug maps onto the source file(s) an auto-fixer must edit.
 *
 * Mirrors the fields the collector needs to build a `DriftEntry`. `fix-drift.ts`
 * hard-requires `builderFile` (non-empty string), `builderFunctions` (non-empty
 * string array), and `sdkShapesFile` (non-empty string) — so every entry here
 * must resolve to a real file with real, non-invented function names.

 * its output against a hand-written SDK-shape fixture in this repo. That is a
 * useful offline CONFORMANCE check (it reds when aimock's own builder changes
 * shape) but it is NOT drift detection: nothing in the loop can observe the
 * vendor, so the surface can silently rot and the drift run stays green.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO default. Omission used to mean "covered" by
 * implication, which is how four Bedrock surfaces and Vertex AI reported as
 * verified while no AWS or Google call has ever been made from this repo.
 * Every entry must state which it is, and `drift-collector.test.ts` re-derives
 * the answer from the emitting sources so a wrong declaration fails CI.
