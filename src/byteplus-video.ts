/**
 * BytePlus Ark (ModelArk / Seedance) async video task lifecycle mock. Submit
 * `POST /api/v3/contents/generations/tasks` returns `{ id }`; status
 * `GET /api/v3/contents/generations/tasks/{id}` polls
 * `queued → running → <recorded terminal status>`.
 *
 * THE FIXTURE FORMAT IS THE ARK TASK ENVELOPE ITSELF, stored as a
 * `RawJSONResponse` (`{ response: { json: … } }`) — NOT a `VideoResponse`. That
 * is the central decision of this surface and it is what lets `cancelled` and
 * `expired` (terminal states with no representation in `VideoResponse.status`)
 * record and replay natively, lets a recorded `error` object replay without
 * inventing a code, and lets `usage`, `framespersecond`, `draft_task_id` and any
 * field the vendor adds later survive because they were recorded rather than
 * enumerated.
 *
 * PROVENANCE OF EVERY WIRE FACT IN THIS FILE. One source: the client library
 * `@tanstack/ai-byteplus@0.3.4` — its `wire-types.ts`, its request builders,
 * and its author's note of live calls made on 2026-07-31. That is a SECONDARY
 * source. BytePlus's own documentation is a client-rendered SPA and was never
 * read; aimock has never called Ark, and no response from Ark has ever been
 * observed here. So "the client library's six status tokens" is a claim this
 * repo can back, and "the vendor's documented six" is not — comments below say
 * the former. Where a fact is not even secondhand, it is named as unverified
 * rather than softened. A verification nobody performed is worse than an
 * admitted gap: it stops the next person from looking.
 *
 * The governing rule: THE MOCK NEVER AUTHORS A WIRE VALUE IT DID NOT OBSERVE.
 * On replay exactly three things are synthesized — the `id` rewrite, the
 * `queued`/`running` token on a NON-terminal poll, and withholding
 * `content`/`error`/`usage` until terminal. Nothing else. There is no default
 * error code, no default error message, no fabricated `usage`, and no
 * placeholder video url: a terminal fixture missing `content.video_url` gets a
 * named warn, not a substituted URL, because the consumer's error naming the
 * real problem beats a download of a URL aimock made up.
 *
 * `video.url` is served AS-IS — aimock does NOT proxy or capture video bytes.
 * Ark's `content.video_url` expires 24h after `updated_at`; replay warns once
 * when a fixture is served past that instant and still serves it.
 *
 * A fixture for this surface MUST carry `match.endpoint: "video"`. Without it
 * `router.ts`'s endpoint/response compatibility gate skips it (a `{ json }`
 * response is not a `VideoResponse`) before this handler ever sees it.

 * array order, `[media: ]` when there are none.
 *
 * WHY the digest: a Seedance image-to-video job carries NO text part, so a
 * text-only key would record `{ endpoint, model }` — a wildcard matching every
 * image-to-video job in the suite for that model. `persistFixture`'s
 * defective-fixture guard would not catch it either, because its `isEmptyMatch`
 * requires `endpoint` to be undefined too. Image-to-video, last-frame and
 * reference-media are first-class Seedance modes, so two recordings with the
 * same prompt and different first frames must stay distinguishable.
 *
 * WHY the marker is UNCONDITIONAL: this key lands in `match.userMessage`, which
 * the router SUBSTRING-matches by default (`useExactMatch = !!requestTransform`).
 * A conditional suffix makes the text-only key `"a guitar"` a prefix of the
 * image-to-video key `"a guitar\n[media: …]"`, so a t2v recording silently
 * serves its own video_url to an i2v request that shares the prompt — a 200
 * with the wrong bytes. Emitting `[media: ]` for the text-only case makes
 * neither key a substring of the other. Prefixing would NOT fix it: the plain
 * text is still contained in the prefixed form.
 *
 * WHY every unrecognised part still contributes: `mediaUrlOf` resolves exactly
 * `image_url` / `video_url` / `audio_url` with a `{ url: string }` wrapper, and
 * the whole wire contract here is unverified against BytePlus. Dropping the
 * parts it cannot resolve reopened both failures above — an all-unrecognised
 * content array returned `""` and minted the very wildcard this key exists to
 * prevent, and two different unrecognised parts collapsed onto one key. They
 * are digested over their own JSON instead, so they stay distinguishable
 * without the key ever carrying the part's payload.
 *
 * The digest is taken over the url string whether that is a public URL or a
 * multi-megabyte `data:` URI, and only 12 hex are kept — the match key stays
 * short and the fixture never grows a data URI.
 *
 * `role` is the declared role, else `first_frame` for an image (the default
 * `@tanstack/ai-byteplus@0.3.4` applies when a request omits the role — not a
 * BytePlus-documented default; nothing here was read from BytePlus), else the

 * still reaches the client as an `X-AIMock-Record-Error` header rather than
 * only as a log line behind a 200 the client cannot distinguish from a clean

 * real Ark task id in a committed artifact leaks it for no benefit.
