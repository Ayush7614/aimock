/**
 * ElevenLabs Voice Design record + replay: `POST /v1/text-to-voice/design`
 * (previews), `POST /v1/text-to-voice` (create a voice from a preview),
 * `GET /v1/voices/{voice_id}`, `DELETE /v1/voices/{voice_id}`.
 *
 * PROVENANCE OF EVERY WIRE FACT IN THIS FILE. Read this before changing a
 * field name, a status code, or a literal below.
 *
 * FIRSTHAND — observed by this repo against live `api.elevenlabs.io` on
 * 2026-09-15, with NO api key and with a deliberately invalid one. No
 * ElevenLabs api key is reachable from this machine (1Password holds an
 * `elevenlabs.io` web login, not a key), so only the pre-auth and auth layers
 * were ever exercised:
 *   - `POST /v1/text-to-voice/design` with a >=20-char `voice_description` and
 *     no credential -> 401
 *     `{"detail":{"type":"authentication_error","code":"unauthorized",
 *      "message":"Neither authorization header nor xi-api-key received, please
 *      provide one.","status":"needs_authorization","request_id":"<hex>"}}`.
 *     Same envelope from `GET /v1/voices/{id}`; with a bogus `xi-api-key` the
 *     message/status become `"Invalid API key"` / `"invalid_api_key"`.
 *   - `voice_description` shorter than 20 chars -> 422 with a pydantic-style
 *     `{"detail":[{"type":"string_too_short","loc":["body",
 *     "voice_description"],...}]}`; `POST /v1/text-to-voice` reports missing
 *     `voice_name` / `generated_voice_id` the same way. So the real service
 *     validates the body BEFORE it authenticates. THIS HANDLER NOW ENFORCES
 *     THAT 20-CODE-POINT MINIMUM on `POST /v1/text-to-voice/design`
 *     (`VOICE_DESCRIPTION_MIN_LENGTH`) and answers with that same `422
 *     {"detail":[...]}` envelope rather than aimock's house error shape — the
 *     one response on this surface whose real shape was observed. The `msg`
 *     STRING it fills in ("String should have at least 20 characters") is
 *     AUTHORED: the observed body was recorded with `msg` elided, so only the
 *     status, the `detail` array and the `loc`/`type` values are firsthand.
 *     ORDER ON `POST /v1/text-to-voice/design`: missing-parameter 400 ->
 *     fixture match (a registered short-description fixture still serves) ->
 *     chaos -> strict refusal / record-mode proxy (so the REAL 422 is recorded
 *     verbatim instead of pre-empted) -> this local 20-code-point 422 ->
 *     no-match 404. `POST /v1/text-to-voice` follows the same order, with its
 *     empty-string 422 in the same slot ahead of the synthesized voice.
 *     The minimum is NOT enforced on `POST /v1/text-to-voice`, whose
 *     `voice_description` bound has never been probed; that route rejects only
 *     an EMPTY description, which is short under any `min_length >= 1`.
 *   - `GET /v1/voices/aimock-nonexistent-voice` -> 400
 *     `{"detail":{"type":"invalid_request","code":"bad_request","message":"An
 *     invalid ID has been received: ...","status":"invalid_uid",...}}`.
 *   KNOWN DIVERGENCE, recorded rather than papered over: every real envelope
 *   above is keyed `detail`, while this handler still emits aimock's house
 *   `{ error: { message, type, code } }` shape — and aimock's own 400/404/503
 *   codes — for EVERY failure except the `voice_description` minimum. That is
 *   deliberate consistency with every other surface here, but it means those
 *   ERROR envelopes are NOT wire-faithful to ElevenLabs. Making the whole
 *   module speak `detail` is a FOLLOW-UP: it is a breaking change for every
 *   existing consumer of this surface, and the shapes of the OTHER failures
 *   (missing parameter, unknown voice, strict-mode refusal) have not been
 *   observed, so they cannot be authored from the one case that has. A
 *   RECORDED fixture is a second exception: it replays the upstream `detail`
 *   body verbatim under the upstream status, so it is faithful by
 *   construction.
 *
 * SECONDARY — the official client `@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js`, pinned to the
 * exact published version `2.68.0` (`node_modules/@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js/
 * package.json` -> `"version": "2.68.0"`). Every claim below was read out of
 * these files, at that version, and nowhere else:
 *   - `api/resources/textToVoice/client/Client.d.ts` /`.js` — the routes, and
 *     the `@throws` list for each (`UnprocessableEntityError` only);
 *   - `api/resources/textToVoice/client/requests/VoiceDesignRequestModel.d.ts`
 *     and `.../BodyCreateANewVoiceFromVoicePreviewV1TextToVoicePost.d.ts` —
 *     the request bodies;
 *   - `api/types/VoiceDesignPreviewResponse.d.ts`,
 *     `api/types/VoicePreviewResponseModel.d.ts`, `api/types/Voice.d.ts`,
 *     `api/types/HttpValidationError.d.ts`, `api/types/ValidationError.d.ts`,
 *     `api/types/ValidationErrorLocItem.d.ts` — the response models;
 *   - the matching `serialization/types/*.d.ts` `Raw` interfaces and
 *     `serialization/types/*.js` schemas — the on-wire snake_case names and
 *     each field's optional/nullable treatment;
 *   - `api/errors/UnprocessableEntityError.js` (422) and
 *     `api/errors/ConflictError.js` (409, never declared for these routes).
 * It pins:
 *   - the four routes above, and that create-from-preview is `POST
 *     /v1/text-to-voice` taking `voice_name`, `voice_description`,
 *     `generated_voice_id`, optional `labels`;
 *   - the design SUCCESS body `{ previews: [...], text }` where each preview is
 *     `{ audio_base_64, generated_voice_id, media_type, duration_secs,
 *     language? }` — `language` optional, the rest required;
 *   - `model_id` values `eleven_multilingual_ttv_v2` / `eleven_ttv_v3`;
 *   - the `Voice` object's wire fields. Every key `buildSyntheticVoice()`
 *     emits (`voice_id`, `name`, `category`, `description`, `labels`,
 *     `preview_url`, `available_for_tiers`, `settings`, `sharing`,
 *     `high_quality_base_model_ids`, `samples`, `safety_control`,
 *     `voice_verification` with its four inner keys, `permission_on_resource`,
 *     `is_owner`, `is_legacy`, `is_mixed`) appears in `Voice.Raw` /
 *     `VoiceVerificationResponse.Raw`, and `"generated"` is one of that SDK's
 *     six `VoiceCategory` tokens;
 *   - `DELETE /v1/voices/{id}` answering `{ status: "ok" }`.
 *   ElevenLabs' own documentation site is a client-rendered SPA and was NOT
 *   read; the SDK is the only document behind these shapes.
 *
 * UNVERIFIED / HAND-AUTHORED — name it, do not soften it:
 *   - NO successful response from ElevenLabs has ever been observed by this
 *     repo, for any of these four routes. There is no recorded fixture or tape
 *     for this surface anywhere in the tree; the drift test in
 *     `src/__tests__/drift/elevenlabs-voice.drift.ts` restates the same
 *     hand-authored shape it checks, so it detects mock-vs-fixture divergence
 *     only and can
 *     never detect divergence from the real API.
 *   - The VALUES `buildSyntheticVoice()` fills those fields with (`null`s, `[]`,
 *     `is_owner: true`, `is_legacy`/`is_mixed` false, the zeroed
 *     `voice_verification`) are aimock's choices for a just-created voice, not
 *     anything observed. The SDK marks all of them optional and nullable, so
 *     they are plausible, not confirmed.
 *   - `voice_id === generated_voice_id` for a created voice. AUTHORED — see
 *     `buildSyntheticVoice()`. The SDK relates the two nowhere; aimock picks
 *     the alias so a caller can GET back what it just created. No code should
 *     depend on it as a wire fact.
 *   - Re-creating an already-created `generated_voice_id` overwrites and
 *     answers 200. AUTHORED — see `rememberElevenLabsVoice()`. The real
 *     behaviour is unknown and the SDK declares no `ConflictError` for the
 *     route, so aimock warns through the module logger instead of inventing a
 *     rejection.
 *   - `Voice.Raw` carries further fields this handler never emits
 *     (`fine_tuning`, `verified_languages`, `collection_ids`,
 *     `created_at_unix`, `favorited_at_unix`, `is_bookmarked`,
 *     `recording_quality`, `labelling_status`, `recording_quality_reason`). A
 *     consumer reading them off a replayed voice gets `undefined`.
 *   The standing rule still holds: THE MOCK NEVER AUTHORS A WIRE VALUE IT DID
 *   NOT OBSERVE. This surface currently does, and this block is where that debt
 *   is declared. Recording one real design + create round-trip against a funded
 *   key would retire most of it.

 *
 * AUTHORED: a second create for a `voice_id` already in the store OVERWRITES
 * the first, and still answers 200. Whether the real
 * `POST /v1/text-to-voice` accepts an already-consumed `generated_voice_id` is
 * UNKNOWN to this repo — no successful create has ever been observed, and
 * `@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js@2.68.0` gives no signal either way: its
 * `api/resources/textToVoice/client/Client.d.ts` declares only
 * `@throws UnprocessableEntityError` for `create`, and never `ConflictError`
 * (`api/errors/ConflictError.js`), so authoring a 409 here would be inventing a

 * oldest-inserted entries are deleted with no log line and no error: a later
 * `GET /v1/voices/{id}` for an evicted voice is indistinguishable from one for
 * a voice that never existed (404, or 503 under strict). It is NOT LRU —
 * reading a voice does not refresh it, and re-saving an existing `voice_id`
 * keeps its ORIGINAL insertion slot, because `Map.set` on a present key does
 * not reorder. The cap exists to bound a long-lived mock process, not to model
 * anything ElevenLabs does; at 10k voices per process no test approaches it.

 * `DeleteVoiceResponseModel`, whose only wire field is `status: string`, and

 * used to be deleted from the map and answered 200 without the request ever
 * leaving the process, so the real voice leaked upstream and the tape got a
 * hole exactly where the delete belonged. Record mode forwards regardless of

 * rule the fixture-replay branch applies: a refused delete must not lose the
